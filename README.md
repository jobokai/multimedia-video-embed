## ReadMe - Steps to Leaps Video Feed

There are a few quirks for the video feed system that are noted below. Please follow the instructions, if you have questions feel free to reach out to itslweb.

1.) Anchors - For anchors, please do not use the Cascade anchor button but rather; go into the HTML view and add an ID to the paragraph or a span tag. If you use the Cascade button, it will wrap the entire description in an anchor tag which causes many issues.

2.) Images - I have it setup so that you could put an image in the description. This will only support images that are on the PRV - Steps To Leaps website. You are not able to use cross site images.

3.) Hyperlinks - You can use internal or external links. For internal links however, you will only be able to use pages within the PRV - Steps To Leaps website. Currently you will only be able to link to PHP pages within the site. If there is a need to link to a document (pdf) please contact ITSLWEB.

4.) HTML Formatting - You can use all of the standard html formatting.

5.) Quotes - Due to the nature of how this system is built, standard quote characters (") can not be used. Please refrain from using these and try alternate methods for quotes (italics for example would be a good alternative).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
